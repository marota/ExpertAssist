# Co-Study4Grid

**Co-Study4Grid** is a full-stack web application for **power grid contingency analysis and N-1 planning**. It provides an interactive interface on top of the [`expert_op4grid_recommender`](https://github.com/marota/Expert_op4grid_recommender) library, letting grid operators simulate element disconnections, visualize network overflows, and explore prioritized remedial actions — topology changes, PST tap adjustments, renewable curtailment, and load shedding — individually or combined.

> Formerly known as **ExpertAssist**. Rebranded to Co-Study4Grid in release 0.4 (PR #65).

## Key Features

### Contingency analysis & remediation
- **Two-step N-1 workflow**: detect overloads first (`run-analysis-step1`), let the operator pick which ones to resolve, then stream suggestions (`run-analysis-step2`). The legacy one-shot `run-analysis` endpoint is still exposed for backward compatibility.
- **AC/DC fallback**: analysis runs on the AC load flow and transparently falls back to DC when AC fails to converge.
- **Prioritized action feed** with search, filter, star / reject, and per-action metadata — severity, MW deltas, rho after action, impacted overloaded lines.
- **Manual action simulation** from the score table, including a *"Make a first guess"* shortcut when no suggestion is loaded.
- **Combined actions** (PR #62 family): evaluate pairs of actions via a fast **superposition (beta-coefficient) estimation** or a full exact simulation, through the *Computed Pairs* / *Explore Pairs* modal. See [`docs/combined-actions.md`](docs/combined-actions.md).
- **Full remedial action catalog**:
  - Topological switches and bus reconfiguration
  - **Phase Shifting Transformer (PST)** tap adjustment with tap-start / target columns, re-simulation, and superposition fallback (PR #78)
  - **Renewable curtailment** and **load shedding** via the `set_load_p` / `set_gen_p` power-reduction format, with configurable MW reduction (PR #72, #73). See [`docs/curtailment-loadshedding-pst-actions.md`](docs/curtailment-loadshedding-pst-actions.md).

### Visualization
- **Four synchronized tabs** — *Network N*, *Contingency N-1*, *Remedial Action*, *Overflow Analysis* — rendered as pypowsybl Network-Area Diagrams (NAD) with flow-delta overlays.
- **Detachable tabs** (PR #86): pop any visualization tab out into a second browser window for dual-monitor workflows, with per-window pan/zoom, tie/untie, and automatic reattach. See [`docs/detachable-viz-tabs.md`](docs/detachable-viz-tabs.md).
- **Single-Line Diagrams (SLD)** for voltage levels in N, N-1, and post-action states, with persistent highlight of impacted switches and coupling breakers (PR #63).
- **Focused sub-diagrams**: auto-generate a NAD centered on a specific element with configurable depth — useful for inspecting parts of 10k-branch grids.
- **Robust highlighting**: contingencies, overloads and impacted assets are drawn as clone-based halos that survive pan, zoom, SLD overlay, and action-target dimming.
- **Auto-zoom** on contingency, newly overloaded line, or action target; pinned sticky feed summary and overload-click to jump to the N-1 tab (PR #88).
- **Zoom-tier level-of-detail** (PR #76): labels, nodes and flow arrows are dynamically boosted proportional to `sqrt(diagramSize / referenceSize)`, so large grids remain legible at any zoom.

### Sessions & replay
- **Save Results** / **Reload Session**: export the complete analysis state (config, contingency, actions with status tags, combined pairs, overflow PDF, loading ratios) to a timestamped session folder. See [`docs/save-results.md`](docs/save-results.md).
- **Replay-ready interaction log**: every UI interaction is written to `interaction_log.json` as a self-contained, timestamped event with correlation IDs for async completions — suitable for deterministic browser-automation replay. See [`docs/interaction-logging.md`](docs/interaction-logging.md).
- **Persistent user config**: paths, recommender parameters and UI preferences persist across sessions through a user-writable config file outside the repo (PR #59).
- **Confirmation dialogs** before destructive state resets (switching network, applying settings on an active study) so operators never lose work by accident.

### Frontend engineering
- **React 19 + TypeScript 5.9 + Vite 7**, strict mode (`noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`).
- **Phase 1 refactor** (PR #74): `App.tsx` reduced from ~2100 → ~650 lines, now a pure state-orchestration hub; UI split into focused presentational components under `components/` and `components/modals/`.
- **Phase 2 state-management optimization** (PR #75): memoized wrappers, centralized state resets, `React.memo` on heavy children — eliminates unnecessary re-renders of the three heaviest components.
- **React ErrorBoundary** wrapping the app root (PR #82) to contain crashes.
- **Vitest + React Testing Library** unit tests co-located as `*.test.tsx`.
- **Standalone single-file UI** (`standalone_interface.html`) mirroring every feature of the React app, for zero-install demos.

## Performance Highlights (release 0.5.0)

Measured on the full French grid (~10k branches) with `scripts/profile_diagram_perf.py`. Full write-up in [`docs/PR_PERF_OPTIMIZATION.md`](docs/PR_PERF_OPTIMIZATION.md) and [`docs/performance_profiling.md`](docs/performance_profiling.md).

| Metric                              | Before   | After   | Speed-up   |
|-------------------------------------|----------|---------|------------|
| `care_mask` / overload detection    | 12.17 s  | 0.01 s  | **~1,100×** |
| Branch flow extraction              | 0.82 s   | 0.06 s  | **~13×**    |
| Flow delta computation              | 0.47 s   | 0.01 s  | **~47×**    |
| `get_obs()` call overhead           | 0.65 s   | 0.01 s  | **~65×**    |
| **Total manual-action simulation**  | ~16.5 s  | ~4.0 s  | **~4×**     |
| Base diagram rendering              | ~7.2 s   | ~3.5 s  | **~2×**     |
| N-1 contingency analysis            | ~19.8 s  | ~12.9 s | ~1.5×       |

**How it was achieved**:
- Vectorized the `care_mask` loop, flow extraction and delta computation with NumPy.
- Observation caching in the manual-action loop (eliminates redundant `get_obs()` refetches).
- Pre-built `SimulationEnvironment` and `dict_action` reused across steps.
- `lxml`-based NaN stripping + gzip compression for large SVG payloads (PR #70).
- Frontend: throttled datalist rendering, zoom guard, level-of-detail tiers, and stable portal target for detached tabs to avoid unmount/remount cascades.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** with:
  - [`pypowsybl`](https://pypowsybl.readthedocs.io/)
  - [`expert_op4grid_recommender`](https://github.com/marota/Expert_op4grid_recommender)
  - [`grid2op`](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/), [`pandapower`](https://pandapower.readthedocs.io/), [`lightsim2grid`](https://lightsim2grid.readthedocs.io/)
- **Node.js 18+** and npm

## Getting Started

### 1. Install backend dependencies

```bash
pip install -r expert_backend/requirements.txt
pip install -r overrides.txt
```

> `pypowsybl` and `expert_op4grid_recommender` must already be installed in your Python environment.

### 2. Start the backend

```bash
python -m expert_backend.main
# or
uvicorn expert_backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API server starts on `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Install and start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the Vite dev-server URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

### 4. Use the application

1. Open **Settings → Paths** and set the network directory (containing `.xiidm` files), the action definition JSON, and optionally an output folder for saved sessions.
2. Click **Load Study** to load the network.
3. Pick a disconnectable element (line or transformer) from the searchable dropdown — the N-1 diagram is fetched with overloads highlighted automatically.
4. Click **Analyze & Suggest** (two-step flow): select which overloads to resolve, then watch the action feed stream in.
5. Inspect prioritized actions, simulate manual ones, or open the **Combine** modal to explore action pairs.
6. Detach any visualization tab (`⧉`) onto a second screen for dual-monitor studies.
7. Hit **Save Results** to export the full session; **Reload Session** restores it exactly, without re-simulating anything.

## Standalone Interface

`standalone_interface.html` is a self-contained single-file version of the UI that can be opened directly in a browser (pointed at a running backend). It mirrors every feature of the React app — including detachable tabs, SLD highlights, combined actions, PST / curtailment / load-shedding cards, interaction logging, and zoom-tier level of detail — with no build step.

When making UI changes, always mirror them in both the React app and the standalone interface.

---

## Data Formats

- **Network files**: `.xiidm` (loaded by pypowsybl)
- **Action definitions**: `.json` mapping action IDs to descriptions, supporting topology, PST, `set_load_p`, and `set_gen_p` formats
- **Network layouts**: `grid_layout.json` with node-ID → `[x, y]` coordinates
- **Generated outputs**: PDF overflow graphs in `Overflow_Graph/`
- **Session folder**: `costudy4grid_session_<contingency>_<timestamp>/` containing `session.json`, `interaction_log.json`, and an overflow PDF copy
