# CLAUDE.md — `expert_backend/`

FastAPI backend for Co-Study4Grid. Wraps `pypowsybl` (network +
diagrams) and `expert_op4grid_recommender` (analysis + remedial-action
recommendation) behind a stateless HTTP interface consumed by the
React frontend at `http://localhost:8000`.

For the project-wide overview see the root `CLAUDE.md`. For test
conventions and the mock layer that lets the suite run without
`pypowsybl` / `expert_op4grid_recommender` installed see
`expert_backend/tests/CLAUDE.md`.

## Architecture in one paragraph

`main.py` is a thin HTTP layer. All domain state lives on **two
module-level singletons**: `network_service` (raw pypowsybl Network +
metadata queries) and `recommender_service` (everything that needs
analysis state — base network, action dictionary, observation cache,
last-result, NAD prefetch, layout cache, …). `RecommenderService`
inherits from three mixins (`DiagramMixin`, `AnalysisMixin`,
`SimulationMixin`) each owning a slice of behaviour but operating on
the same `self`. The composition is intentional: state lifecycle
(`__init__`, `reset`, `update_config`) stays in `recommender_service.py`
and the mixins reach into it through `self`. Treat the mixins as one
class split across files for readability.

## Singletons & shared state

- `network_service` (`services/network_service.py:352`) — owns the
  `pypowsybl.network.Network` returned by `pn.load()`. Read-only
  consumers (frontend `/api/branches`, `/api/voltage-levels`, …) go
  through it.
- `recommender_service` (`services/recommender_service.py:727`) — owns
  analysis state. `_get_base_network()` MUTUALISES the same Network
  object loaded by `network_service` to avoid re-parsing the .xiidm
  twice (~3-5 s on the PyPSA-EUR France grid). See
  `docs/perf-grid2op-shared-network.md`.

The shared Network is safe because:
1. `network_service` only reads (no variant switching).
2. `recommender_service` switches variants inside
   `_get_n_variant` / `_get_n1_variant` but always restores the
   original variant in a `try/finally`.

`pn.load()` is called WITHOUT `allow_variant_multi_thread_access=True`
on purpose — see the long comment at `network_service.py:30-43` for
why enabling that is unsafe for the FastAPI thread pool today.

## State lifecycle: load → reset → reload

- **First load** (`/api/config` POST): sets `network_service.network`
  via `network_service.load_network()`, then calls
  `recommender_service.update_config(settings)` which:
  1. Updates `expert_op4grid_recommender.config` globals
     (`ENV_PATH`, `LAYOUT_FILE_PATH`, `MIN_*`, monitoring config, …).
  2. Calls `prefetch_base_nad_async()` — kicks a background thread
     that pre-computes the base NAD so the subsequent
     `/api/network-diagram` XHR is a near-instant cache hit. See
     `docs/perf-nad-prefetch.md` and
     `docs/perf-nad-prefetch-earlier-spawn.md`.
  3. Loads the action dictionary (`load_actions` +
     `enrich_actions_lazy`). Auto-generates `disco_*` actions for
     every line if the file lacks them.
  4. Pre-builds a `SimulationEnvironment` cached on
     `_cached_env_context` — saves ~4-8 s per
     `/api/run-analysis-step1` call.

- **Re-load** (any subsequent `/api/config`): `recommender_service.reset()`
  is called BEFORE the new network is loaded. `reset()` MUST clear
  every per-study cache on the service. The full list (also
  documented at `docs/state-reset-and-confirmation-dialogs.md`):
  `_last_result`, `_is_running`, `_generator`, `_base_network`,
  `_simulation_env`, `_last_disconnected_element`, `_dict_action`,
  `_analysis_context`, `_saved_computed_pairs`, `_cached_obs_n*`,
  `_cached_env_context`, `_initial_pst_taps`,
  `_lf_status_by_variant`, `_layout_cache`,
  `_prefetched_base_nad*`. Adding a new instance-level cache?
  Add it here too — otherwise it WILL leak across studies (see the
  `_layout_cache` regression fixed on
  `claude/fix-grid-layout-reset-8TYEV`).

- **Drain order matters**: `reset()` calls
  `_drain_pending_base_nad_prefetch()` FIRST so a still-running
  prefetch thread cannot finish after reset and write into the next
  study's cache.

## API surface (one-liners; root `CLAUDE.md` has the full table)

Diagram & topology:
- `GET  /api/branches` / `/api/voltage-levels` / `/api/nominal-voltages`
  — read-only metadata.
- `GET  /api/network-diagram` — base-state NAD. Serves the
  prefetched diagram when available (saves ~5-6 s on large grids).
  Supports `?format=text` to return a JSON header + raw SVG body
  (saves ~500 ms of `JSON.parse` on 25 MB SVG strings — see
  `docs/perf-loading-parallel.md`).
- `POST /api/n1-diagram` / `/api/action-variant-diagram` /
  `/api/focused-diagram` / `/api/action-variant-focused-diagram`
- `POST /api/n-sld` / `/api/n1-sld` / `/api/action-variant-sld`

Analysis:
- `POST /api/run-analysis-step1` — detect overloads (returns once).
- `POST /api/run-analysis-step2` — resolve, **streaming** NDJSON.
- `POST /api/run-analysis` — single-step legacy NDJSON stream.
- `POST /api/simulate-manual-action` — one-off simulation.
- `POST /api/simulate-and-variant-diagram` — combined NDJSON stream
  emitting `{type:"metrics"}` then `{type:"diagram"}` so the
  sidebar can update ahead of the SVG.
- `POST /api/compute-superposition` — combined-pair effect.

Session & user config:
- `POST /api/save-session`, `GET /api/list-sessions`,
  `POST /api/load-session`, `POST /api/restore-analysis-context`.
- `GET/POST /api/user-config`, `GET/POST /api/config-file-path`.

OS pickers & static:
- `GET  /api/pick-path?type=file|dir` — spawns a tkinter subprocess.
- Static mount at `/results/pdf/` → `Overflow_Graph/`.

## Streaming responses (NDJSON)

`/api/run-analysis`, `/api/run-analysis-step2`, and
`/api/simulate-and-variant-diagram` use FastAPI `StreamingResponse`
with `application/x-ndjson`. Events are JSON lines:
- `{"type":"pdf", "pdf_url":..., "pdf_path":...}` — overflow PDF
  ready (delivered EARLY so the UI can show it before results).
- `{"type":"result", ...}` or `{"type":"metrics", ...}` /
  `{"type":"diagram", ...}` — final payloads.
- `{"type":"error", "message":...}` — failure event; stream closes.

Do NOT route streaming endpoints through `_maybe_gzip_*`. The
per-endpoint gzip helper is for non-streaming responses only —
wrapping NDJSON in gzip buffers events until a flush, breaking the
early-PDF guarantee. This was the root cause behind the global
`GZipMiddleware` rollback (`main.py:30-42`,
`docs/perf-per-endpoint-gzip.md`).

## Per-endpoint gzip

Two helpers in `main.py`:
- `_maybe_gzip_json(payload, request)` — wraps any JSON-serialisable
  payload, gzips when ≥ 10 KB and the client signals
  `Accept-Encoding: gzip`.
- `_maybe_gzip_svg_text(diagram, request)` — JSON header + raw SVG
  body (for `/api/network-diagram?format=text`). Skips the
  client-side `JSON.parse` on the multi-MB SVG string.

Both set `Vary: Accept-Encoding`. Threshold and compression level are
tunable at `main.py:43-44`.

## NumPy → JSON sanitization

pypowsybl returns NumPy scalars / arrays inside dicts that FastAPI's
default JSON encoder rejects. `services/sanitize.py:sanitize_for_json`
recursively coerces them to native Python types and is called in every
endpoint payload. Don't return raw NumPy from a service method —
either call `sanitize_for_json` at the boundary or convert inside the
service itself.

## Variants & load flow

`_get_n_variant()` and `_get_n1_variant(contingency)` clone from a
clean N-state baseline (NEVER from the current working variant — that
could inherit modifications from a prior action simulation). They run
the AC load flow with `_run_ac_with_fallback`, which retries in slow
mode if `PYPOWSYBL_FAST_MODE` is on and AC fails. Variant cache is on
`self._lf_status_by_variant` so `get_n1_diagram` reuses the LF status
without re-running.

`_ensure_n_state_ready()` and `_ensure_n1_state_ready()` are guards
called at the entry of analysis / simulation endpoints. They join any
in-flight NAD prefetch thread (so it can't race on variant changes)
and pin the working variant. Add them to any new entry point that
operates on the shared network.

## Layout cache (`_layout_cache`)

`DiagramMixin._load_layout()` parses `grid_layout.json` into a pandas
DataFrame and caches it on the service keyed by `(path, mtime)`. Used
as `fixed_positions` for NAD generation. Two invariants:
1. `reset()` MUST clear `_layout_cache` (see "State lifecycle"
   above) — otherwise the previous study's layout leaks into the new
   grid's NAD.
2. The `(path, mtime)` key auto-invalidates when the file changes,
   so warm-process workflow stays fast.

## NAD prefetch

`prefetch_base_nad_async()` is called from `update_config()` right
after `LAYOUT_FILE_PATH` is set. It:
1. Pre-warms `self._base_network` in the main thread (so the worker
   sees an O(1) attribute access — no lazy-init race).
2. Spawns a daemon thread named `NADPrefetch` that calls
   `self.get_network_diagram()`.
3. Stores the result on `_prefetched_base_nad`, errors on
   `_prefetched_base_nad_error`, completion on
   `_prefetched_base_nad_event`.

`/api/network-diagram` calls `get_prefetched_base_nad(timeout=60)`
which blocks on the event then either returns the cached diagram or
re-raises the worker exception. Falls through to a fresh compute if
no prefetch was ever started (e.g. tests bypassing `update_config`).

## Adding endpoints

1. Add the Pydantic request model at the top of `main.py` near the
   existing models.
2. Add the route. Import any service method via the singleton
   (`network_service` / `recommender_service`).
3. Wrap non-streaming JSON responses in `_maybe_gzip_json(payload,
   http_request)` if the payload can grow large (≥ 10 KB).
4. Mirror the path in `frontend/src/api.ts` (axios method) and the
   master table in the root `CLAUDE.md` (and add a row to the API
   table there).
5. Add a test under `expert_backend/tests/` — see
   `tests/CLAUDE.md` for the mock layer that lets it run without
   `pypowsybl` installed.

## Adding a new per-study cache

1. Initialise the field in `RecommenderService.__init__` — keep
   them grouped by purpose with a short comment.
2. **Clear it in `reset()`** — same group / order as `__init__`.
3. Document it in the "What `reset()` clears" list in
   `docs/state-reset-and-confirmation-dialogs.md`.
4. If the field holds a thread / future / event, drain or cancel it
   inside `_drain_pending_*` helpers BEFORE clearing the field —
   look at `_drain_pending_base_nad_prefetch` for the pattern.

## Conventions

- **Logging**: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`. Use it
  (no `print`) for new code.
- **No formal Python linter**: code follows PEP 8 manually. Match
  the surrounding style (4-space indent, type hints where helpful,
  docstrings on public methods).
- **Error handling at the API boundary**: services raise standard
  exceptions; `main.py` translates them to `HTTPException` with a
  meaningful detail message. Internal validation that "can't fail"
  shouldn't be there — trust the caller.
- **No backwards-compatibility shims**: when a feature changes,
  update the consumers in the same commit (frontend, standalone
  HTML, tests).
- **`standalone_interface.html` parity**: the root has a self-
  contained single-file mirror of the React UI. UI-related backend
  changes (new endpoints, payload shape changes) need a manual
  mirror there too.

## Running

```bash
# From project root
python -m expert_backend.main
# Or
uvicorn expert_backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

CORS is wide-open (`allow_origins=["*"]`) because the dev frontend
hits the backend cross-origin. Tighten before any non-local
deployment.
