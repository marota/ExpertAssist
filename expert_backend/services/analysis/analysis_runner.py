"""Legacy single-step analysis runner.

Wraps the original ``run_analysis`` with:
  - AC load flow → DC load-flow fallback on the "Initial contingency
    simulation failed" RuntimeError surfaced by the discovery engine
  - a background worker thread so the caller can poll the output
    folder for the overflow-graph PDF and emit a ``pdf`` NDJSON event
    before the full result lands
  - stdout redirection so library ``print`` diagnostics are captured
    as a string, not leaked to the FastAPI process log

Yields NDJSON-ready dicts ``{"type": "pdf", "pdf_path": ...}`` and
a final ``{"analysis_result": ..., "analysis_message": ...,
"dc_fallback_used": ..., "output": ..., "latest_pdf": ...}``.  The
orchestrator on ``AnalysisMixin`` turns that last dict into the
public ``result`` event after enriching actions and scores.
