## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-14

First tagged release under the **Co-Study4Grid** name. This release consolidates the
performance, workflow and UI work from PRs #57 → #91 and ships a stable, production-ready
contingency-analysis assistant for large grids.

### Highlights

- **4× faster manual-action simulation** and **~1,100× faster overload detection** on
  the full French grid (~10k branches), thanks to NumPy vectorization and observation
  caching. See `docs/PR_PERF_OPTIMIZATION.md` and `docs/performance_profiling.md`.
- **Two-step N-1 workflow** (detect → select → resolve) replaces the legacy one-shot
  analysis as the primary user path.
- **Full remedial-action catalog**: topology, PST tap adjustment, renewable curtailment,
  load shedding — individually, manually, or as superposition pairs.
- **Detachable visualization tabs** for dual-monitor workflows.
- **Replay-ready interaction logging** and **session save/reload** that exactly restore
  a study without re-simulating.

### Added

- **Rebrand**: ExpertAssist → Co-Study4Grid (PR #65), MPL-2.0 license banners on all
  code files (PR #67), `AUTHORS.txt`.
- **PST (Phase-Shifting Transformer) actions** (PR #78): tap start / target columns,
  re-simulation from the score table, target-tap sync, superposition fallback for PST
  pairs, robust key lookup for tap parameters.
- **Renewable curtailment** actions integrated end-to-end (PR #72) with the
  `set_gen_p` power-reduction format.
- **Load shedding** actions (PR #61) with configurable MW reduction (PR #73), the new
  `set_load_p` format, SLD highlighting, and score-table re-simulation.
- **Combined actions**: *Computed Pairs* and *Explore Pairs* modal, superposition
  estimation, full-simulation fallback, and UI restrictions on LS/RC combinations
  (PR #72). Pair estimations refresh on re-simulation.
- **Detachable visualization tabs** (PR #84, #86, #87, #90): pop Network N / N-1 /
  Action / Overflow tabs into a second browser window, with tie/untie, per-window
  pan/zoom preservation, bidirectional controls, and stable-portal DOM move to avoid
  unmount/remount cascades. See `docs/detachable-viz-tabs.md`.
- **SLD impacted-asset highlights** (PR #63): clone-behind halos for switches and
  coupling breakers, robust across pan/zoom and N-1/action state changes.
- **MW Start column** in action score tables (PR #62), with `get_virtual_line_flow`
  for open-coupling and load-shedding rows.
- **Focused sub-diagrams** (`/api/focused-diagram`, `/api/action-variant-focused-diagram`)
  with configurable depth for inspecting specific VL neighborhoods on large grids.
- **Zoom-tier level-of-detail** (PR #76): dynamic proportional boosting of labels, nodes
  and flow arrows based on `sqrt(diagramSize / referenceSize)` — mirrored in the
  standalone interface.
- **Contingency / overload auto-zoom and sticky feed** (PR #88): pinned compact summary,
  overload-click jumps to N-1 tab, VIEWING ribbon on action cards, max-rho-line zoom
  fallback when the newly overloaded line isn't a branch.
- **Save Results / Reload Session** (PR #62 family): timestamped session folders with
  `session.json`, `interaction_log.json`, and a copy of the overflow PDF. Restores
  actions, combined pairs, per-action enrichments, and sidebar loading ratios with no
  re-simulation. Documented in `docs/save-results.md`.
- **Replay-ready interaction logging** (PR #64): self-contained timestamped events with
  correlation IDs for async completions, suitable for deterministic browser-automation
  replay. See `docs/interaction-logging.md`.
- **Persistent user configuration** (PR #59) stored outside the repository, with a
  configurable config-file path.
- **Confirmation dialogs** (PR #83) before destructive state resets (switching network
  while a study is loaded; applying settings on an active study).
- **React ErrorBoundary** wrapping the app root (PR #82).
- **"Make a first guess" shortcut** in the empty Selected Actions section (PR #87),
  preserving manual actions through Analyze & Suggest.
- **Monitoring Factor Thermal Limits** parameter in Settings (PR #59).
- **User-facing documentation** under `docs/` covering performance, save/reload,
  interaction logging, combined actions, detachable tabs, curtailment/load-shedding/PST,
  and code-quality analysis.

### Changed

- **App.tsx refactor — Phase 1** (PR #74): reduced from ~2100 → ~650 lines; `App.tsx`
  is now a state-orchestration hub only. UI extracted into presentational components
  under `components/` and `components/modals/`; `useSettings` hook exposes a single
  `SettingsState` object passed wholesale to `SettingsModal` to avoid prop drilling.
- **State management — Phase 2** (PR #75): memoized cross-hook wrappers with
  `useCallback`, centralized state-reset logic, and `React.memo` on the three heaviest
  components (`VisualizationPanel`, `ActionFeed`, `OverloadPanel`).
- **Oversized components split** (PR #81): large frontend components decomposed into
  focused subcomponents with dedicated test suites.
- **Two-step analysis flow** is now the primary user path; legacy `/api/run-analysis`
  kept for compatibility.
- **Backend diagram helpers** (`_load_network`, `_load_layout`, `_default_nad_parameters`,
  `_generate_diagram`) deduplicate diagram-generation logic across endpoints.
- **CORS / network hosts**: API base URL aligned to `127.0.0.1:8000` in tests.
- **CLAUDE.md / standalone interface** kept in lock-step with the React app on every
  UI change.

### Performance

- **Vectorized `care_mask` & overload detection** (PR #66): 12.17 s → 0.01 s
  (**~1,100×** speed-up).
- **Vectorized branch flow extraction**: 0.82 s → 0.06 s (**~13×**).
- **Vectorized flow delta computation**: 0.47 s → 0.01 s (**~47×**).
- **Observation caching** in manual-action loop: 0.65 s → 0.01 s (**~65×**).
- **Total manual-action simulation latency**: ~16.5 s → ~4.0 s (**~4×**).
- **Base diagram rendering**: ~7.2 s → ~3.5 s.
- **Backend NaN stripping via `lxml`** and **gzip compression** for large SVG payloads
  (PR #70).
- **Pre-built `SimulationEnvironment` and `dict_action`** passed into
  `run-analysis-step1` to avoid rebuilding on every step (PR #70).
- **Frontend throttling**: datalist rendering throttled, zoom guard on exact matches,
  NaN fix in SVG boost (PR #70).
- **Overflow-graph display timing** fixed and covered by regression tests (PR #70).
- **Performance-budget test suite** (PR #66, #68) covering vectorized logic, cache
  invalidation and a small-grid simulation budget, with warm-up to absorb cold-start
  noise.
- **Eliminated contingency-search freeze** and restored automatic zoom on N-1
  diagrams (PR #77).

### Fixed

- **Second-contingency crash**, auto-zoom loss on contingency switch, and overload
  persistence across successive studies (PR #80).
- **`min_renewable_curtailment_actions`** missing from saved config (PR #80).
- **Auto-zoom double injection** on contingency switch — `MemoizedSvgContainer` kept
  always mounted (PR #81).
- **N-1 variant clone** now made from the clean N state, not the working variant (PR #81).
- **Action target asset dimming** in the standalone interface: force full opacity on
  originals (PR #71).
- **Contingency highlight z-ordering**: sibling insertion with solid yellow halo,
  surviving pan/zoom and SLD overlay (PR #71).
- **Overload highlight thresholds** and loading display values (PR #71).
- **Monitoring-factor scaling** restored for suggested actions (PR #71).
- **Superposition monitoring** aligned with `simulate_manual_action`, with
  overloaded lines force-included in the `eligible_mask` (PR #79).
- **PST re-simulation** preserves `_dict_action` structure; additive superposition
  fallback for PST no-op; proper element identification in `compute_superposition`
  (PR #78, #79).
- **Combined-action estimation filtering**: heavily loaded N-state lines are no longer
  incorrectly filtered out (PR #72).
- **`gen_p` / observation-sequence / legacy keys / islanding reporting** regressions in
  the backend after manual-action enrichment refactor (PR #72, #73).
- **Re-simulate double-click bug** on action cards (PR #73).
- **SLD rendering regressions**: blank screen, missing N-1 highlight,
  `ReferenceError` crash in the overlay (PR #76).
- **Grid layout functionality** restored with regression tests (PR #69).
- **Settings pickers**, action-table sync, blank diagram after pair simulation, and
  action-bucket preservation on re-simulation (PR #82 family).

## Earlier Development (pre-0.5.0)

Prior to the Co-Study4Grid rebrand (PR #65), the project was developed as **ExpertAssist**
with an iterative series of merged PRs (#57–#65) that built up:

- The initial FastAPI backend and React + TypeScript frontend scaffolding.
- Network loading, branch listing, N-1 contingency diagrams and the first
  single-step analysis flow.
- Progressive alignment between the React app and the `standalone_interface.html`
  single-file UI.
- Early interaction-logging, config-persistence and network-diagram fixes that paved
  the way for the 0.5.0 consolidation.

These are not enumerated here — the git history (`git log`) and GitHub PR list remain
the authoritative reference for pre-0.5.0 work.
